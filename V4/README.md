# DiscordDeepLBot Hack-with-me v4

Version 4 moves to the newer implementation of discordpy. This means we have to move to using async for our main function. This also allows us to utilise cogs, and start being a little smarter with the commands. 

As of V4 code will be snippets, not entire file as we are using multiple files from this version
